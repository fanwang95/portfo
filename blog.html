                  <p>The homeplace of Jazz, deep-dish pizza and the worldâ€™s first skyscraper, Chicago is second to no city. As the third-largest city in the U.S., Chicago is one of the cleanest, greenest, and friendliest big cities. From comedy to world-class museums, Chi-Town has something for everyone, including a gorgeous train station where some of the most beautiful long-haul train routes begin their journey. When in Chicago, do not forget to take an architectural trip on a boat. This trip will definitely change your mind.</p>

                  <p>There are a lot of beautiful, sunshiny destinations on the western side of the US. But there's a different atmosphere altogether that comes once you venture more up north to the Pacific Northwest. Stereotypically  associated with rain and muggy clouds, Seattle wouldn't honestly have crossed my mind if it wasn't for letting my boyfriend pick. But there's a cool, urban, slightly grungy, yet entirely modern air to downtown Seattle that's thriving and altogether electrifying 365 days a year, rain, wind, or shine.</p>

                  <h1>Smoky Mountains</h1>
                  <p>The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most popular National Park in the country. You can drive right through it in less than day, pop out of your car at a few overlooks, and take in the view. With over 800 miles of hiking trails, from half-mile easy walks to multi-day tests of your endurance, there is something here for everyone.During our visit in early November, the weather was less than ideal. But We still enjoyed our visit even though we never got to see those sweeping views over the Smoky Mountains.</p>
